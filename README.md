### Development environment

Please use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to check for correct formatting
and other issues before creating commits. To do this automatically, you can add
it as a git hook:

```
# If you don't have pre-commit already:
pip install pre-commit

# Setup git hook:
pre-commit install
```

Now `pre-commit` will run automatically on `git commit`!
