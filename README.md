# Threadbare Origins: InkDrinker

This project is a simple game created by [Endless
Access](https://access.endlessstudios.com) to help ease the learning curve into
collaborative game design and development.

It is intended to be used as practice content for learning Git and GitHub
collaboration.

Thematically, it is an origin story for the InkDrinker antagonists in
[Threadbare](https://github.com/endlessm/threadbare/).
